# MORED Dataset Converter

The data to be downloaded is the "WPILGT data" from the link [https://moredataset.github.io/MORED/](https://moredataset.github.io/MORED/).
After downloading the data, you must organize it into a structure like the one shown in [structure.txt](structure.txt).

Note: The metadata provided by the authors partially follows the NILMTK standard, so it has been modified to create the converter. Mainly changed device names that were not compatible with nilm_metadata.
