  description: >
    An all in one two circuit energy monitor and base-station which collects
    data, hosts the emonCMS software and can also receive data from other
    sensor nodes. emonPi measures real (active) power, rms value of voltage.
  sample_period: 5   # the interval between samples. In seconds.
  max_sample_period: 5   # Max allowable interval between samples. Seconds.
  measurements:
  - physical_quantity: voltage   
    upper_limit: 5000
    lower_limit: 0
  - physical_quantity: power   
    type: active   #(real power)
    upper_limit: 5000
    lower_limit: 0
